***Flowchart comments***

Rename the "plotter function" into "Resulting structure plotter" because we obtain
the results and plot them such that we understand how the aileron structure looks like.

Change the part of the load modes into:
- Point loads	--> axial loads, shear loads
- Bending loads	--> axial loads
- Torsional loads  --> shear force

Give the two Numerical Integrator Functions different names if they are not the same function.

Questions:
	Are all the results obtained from the displacement angle? 
	For the Numerical Integrator & Transformation Function what is the purpose of 
	having the Numerical Parameters block next to it? Is this because the functions
	can be altered by the use of given parameters?
